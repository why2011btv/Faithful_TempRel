Some weights of the model checkpoint at google/bigbird-roberta-large were not used when initializing BigBirdModel: ['cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'cls.predictions.bias', 'cls.predictions.decoder.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.weight', 'cls.predictions.decoder.bias', 'cls.seq_relationship.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BigBirdModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BigBirdModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
